00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:13.503
I am reaching out to you because I need your
help.

00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:14.503
We want to end gender inequality—and to
do that we need everyone to be involved.

00:00:14.503 --> 00:00:15.503
This is the first campaign of its kind at
the UN: we want to try and galvanize as many

00:00:15.503 --> 00:00:16.503
men and boys as possible to be advocates for
gender equality.

00:00:16.503 --> 00:00:17.503
And we don’t just want to talk about it,
but make sure it is tangible.

00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:20.599
I was appointed six months ago and the more
I have spoken about feminism the more I have

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:31.050
realized that fighting for women’s rights
has too often become synonymous with man-hating.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.730
If there is one thing I know for certain,
it is that this has to stop.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:48.850
For the record, feminism by definition is:
“The belief that men and women should have

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.460
equal rights and opportunities.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:02.120
It is the theory of the political, economic
and social equality of the sexes.”

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.220
I started questioning gender-based assumptions
when at eight I was confused at being called

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.800
“bossy,” because I wanted to direct the
plays we would put on for our parents—but

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.610
the boys were not.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.700
When at 14 I started being sexualized by certain
elements of the press.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.070
When at 15 my girlfriends started dropping
out of their sports teams because they didn’t

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.870
want to appear “muscly.”

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:43.390
When at 18 my male friends were unable to
express their feelings.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.870
I decided I was a feminist and this seemed
uncomplicated to me.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:02:08.110
But my recent research has shown me that feminism
has become an unpopular word.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:20.930
Apparently I am among the ranks of women whose
expressions are seen as too strong, too aggressive,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.640
isolating, anti-men and, unattractive.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.330
Why is the word such an uncomfortable one?

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.160
I am from Britain and think it is right that
as a woman I am paid the same as my male counterparts.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.319
I think it is right that I should be able
to make decisions about my own body.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.780
I think it is right that women be involved

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.400
on my behalf in the policies and decision-making
of my country.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:10.620
I think it is right that socially I am afforded
the same respect as men.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:20.310
But sadly I can say that there is no one country
in the world where all women can expect to

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.540
receive these rights.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.850
No country in the world can yet say they have
achieved gender equality.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.850
These rights I consider to be human rights
but I am one of the lucky ones.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.850
My life is a sheer privilege because my parents
didn’t love me less because I was born a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.850
daughter.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.850
My school did not limit me because I was a
girl.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.850
My mentors didn’t assume I would go less
far because I might give birth to a child

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.850
one day.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.850
These influencers were the gender equality
ambassadors that made me who I am today.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.850
They may not know it, but they are the inadvertent
feminists who are changing the world today.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.850
And we need more of those.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.850
And if you still hate the word—it is not
the word that is important but the idea and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.850
the ambition behind it.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.850
Because not all women have been afforded the
same rights that I have.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.850
In fact, statistically, very few have been.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.850
In 1995, Hilary Clinton made a famous speech
in Beijing about women’s rights.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.850
Sadly many of the things she wanted to change
are still a reality today.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.850
But what stood out for me the most was that
only 30 per cent of her audience were male.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.850
How can we affect change in the world when
only half of it is invited or feel welcome

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.850
to participate in the conversation?

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:47.850
Men—I would like to take this opportunity
to extend your formal invitation.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.850
Gender equality is your issue too.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.850
Because to date, I’ve seen my father’s
role as a parent being valued less by society

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.850
despite my needing his presence as a child
as much as my mother’s.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.850
I’ve seen young men suffering from mental
illness unable to ask for help for fear it

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.850
would make them look less “macho”—in
fact in the UK suicide is the biggest killer

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:53.850
of men between 20-49 years of age; eclipsing
road accidents, cancer and coronary heart

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.850
disease.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.850
I’ve seen men made fragile and insecure
by a distorted sense of what constitutes male

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.850
success.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.850
Men don’t have the benefits of equality
either.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.850
We don’t often talk about men being imprisoned
by gender stereotypes but I can see that that

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.850
they are and that when they are free, things
will change for women as a natural consequence.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.850
If men don’t have to be aggressive in order
to be accepted women won’t feel compelled

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.850
to be submissive.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:02.850
If men don’t have to control, women won’t
have to be controlled.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.850
Both men and women should feel free to be
sensitive.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.850
Both men and women should feel free to be
strong…

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.850
It is time that we all perceive gender on
a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.850
If we stop defining each other by what we
are not and start defining ourselves by what

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.850
we are—we can all

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:08.850
be freer and this is what HeForShe is about.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.850
It’s about freedom.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.850
I want men to take up this mantle.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.850
So their daughters, sisters and mothers can
be free from prejudice but also so that their

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.850
sons have permission to be vulnerable and
human too—reclaim those parts of themselves

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.850
they abandoned and in doing so be a more true
and complete version of themselves.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.850
You might be thinking who is this Harry Potter
girl?

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.850
And what is she doing up on stage at the UN.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.850
It’s a good question and trust me, I have
been asking myself the same thing.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.850
I don’t know if I am qualified to be here.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.850
All I know is that I care about this problem.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.850
And I want to make it better.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.850
And having seen what I’ve seen—and given
the chance—I feel it is my duty to say something.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.850
English Statesman Edmund Burke said: “All
that is needed for the forces of evil to triumph

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.850
is for enough good men and women to do nothing.”

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.850
In my nervousness for this speech and in my
moments of doubt I’ve told myself firmly—if

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.850
not me, who, if not now, when.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.850
If you have similar doubts when opportunities
are presented to you I hope those words might

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.850
be helpful.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.850
Because the reality is that if we do nothing
it will take 75 years, or for me to be nearly

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.850
a hundred before women can expect to be paid
the same as men for the same work.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.850
15.5 million girls will be married in the
next 16 years as children.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.850
And at current rates it won’t be until 2086
before all rural African girls will be able

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.850
to receive a secondary education.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.850
If you believe in equality, you might be one
of those inadvertent feminists I spoke of

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.850
earlier.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.850
And for this I applaud you.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.850
We are struggling for a uniting word but the
good news is we have a uniting movement.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.850
It is called HeForShe.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.850
I am inviting you to step forward, to be seen
to speak up, to be the "he" for "she".

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.850
And to ask yourself if not me, who?

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.850
If not now, when?

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.852
Thank you.
